				<div class="text-box">
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Wind energy is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of wind to generate electricity. Wind turbines are used to convert the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. These turbines have blades that are connected to a rotor, which spins as wind blows over them. The spinning rotor then turns a generator, which produces electricity.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Wind energy has several advantages over conventional sources of energy. For one, it is a clean source of energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions or pollution. Wind energy is also abundant and available in many parts of the world, making it a reliable and sustainable source of power. Additionally, wind energy is cost-competitive with other sources of energy, and the cost of wind power has been decreasing rapidly in recent years.</p>

			<div class="text-box">
				<p style="font-size: 17px;">Tidal energy is a form of renewable energy that is generated by harnessing the power of ocean tides. As the tides are driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, tidal energy is a reliable and predictable source of renewable energy. There are various technologies used to harness tidal energy, including tidal barrages, tidal turbines, and tidal lagoons.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 17px;">Tidal barrages are large dams that are built across estuaries or bays. When the tide comes in, the water flows into the barrage, and as the tide goes out, the water is released, spinning turbines that generate electricity. Tidal turbines are similar to wind turbines, but they are submerged underwater and are designed to operate in the strong currents created by tides. Tidal lagoons are artificial basins built along the coast that capture the incoming tides and use them to drive turbines to generate electricity.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17px;">Tidal energy has several advantages over other forms of renewable energy. It is a consistent and predictable source of energy, unlike solar and wind energy, which are dependent on weather conditions. Tidal energy also has a higher energy density than wind and solar energy, meaning that it can generate more power from a smaller area. However, tidal energy is still in the early stages of development, and there are challenges associated with the technology, such as high capital costs, environmental impacts, and limited availability of suitable sites for tidal energy projects. Despite these challenges, tidal energy has the potential to play an important role in the renewable energy mix, particularly in coastal regions with high tidal ranges.</p>

			<div class="text-box">
				<p style="font-size:17px;">Geothermal energy is a form of renewable energy that is generated by harnessing the natural heat of the earth's interior. The heat is generated by the natural decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust and mantle, and it is transferred to the surface through conduction and convection. Geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling buildings, generating electricity, and other industrial applications.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17px;">The most common method of generating electricity from geothermal energy involves drilling deep wells into hot geothermal reservoirs, which are then used to produce steam. The steam is used to turn turbines and generate electricity, which is then fed into the power grid. In addition to generating electricity, geothermal energy can also be used for direct heating and cooling applications, such as heating homes and buildings.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17px;">Geothermal energy is a reliable and predictable source of renewable energy that can provide baseload power, which means it can operate continuously and is not dependent on weather conditions. It is also a clean source of energy that emits minimal greenhouse gases and other pollutants. However, geothermal energy requires specialized technology and infrastructure, and it is only available in certain areas with high geothermal potential.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17px;">India has a significant potential for geothermal energy, with estimated reserves of up to 10 GW. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has included geothermal energy under its Renewable Energy Program and has initiated various research and development projects to explore the potential of geothermal energy in India. While there are currently no specific government schemes in India exclusively focused on geothermal energy, the MNRE has implemented various initiatives and schemes to support the development of renewable energy, which could indirectly benefit the development of geothermal energy projects.</p>
